# Eden Project
Eden is a platform geared to individuals, who are environmentally aware with the aim to connect people to have a positive impact in sustaining and developing possible solutions to our respective, eco-friendly community.

## Description
Eden is based on the idea of people bonding together with one purpose in mind: Communities prosper and endure. We strive to build a community between employers and employees, event manager and attendees, advocates and their volunteers to create community that caters toward having sustainable eco-friendly environment.

## Mission Statement
Our mission is to connect people through club, event, job and volunteer opportunities based on their passion to contribute back to their respectful community. Through our built connections, we will build a platform that does not just connect people, but create a niche where like-minded people gather around to contribute their fair share to the environment.
